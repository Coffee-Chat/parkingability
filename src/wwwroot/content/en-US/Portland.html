    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
        Current guidelines apply to both types of DMV Disabled Parking Placards:
        Disabled Person Parking Placards and Wheelchair User Placards.
        Wheelchair User Placards can be distinguished from Disabled Person Parking Placards by the large white &quot;W&quot; in the upper right-hand corner by the wheelchair insignia, the words &quot;Wheelchair User&quot; towards the bottom, and the light blue color of the placard.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are traveling from out of state and your state offers a general disabled parking placard, <b>follow the same parking regulations as people with Oregon disabled placards. If your state offers a wheelchair placard, follow the same parking regulations as people with Oregon Wheelchair User placards</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>I have a Wheelchair User Parking Placard</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Wounded Warrior and Wheelchair Placards holders are exempt from paying at the meter, and may extend the posted time limit for all stalls that are at least 30 minutes (this excludes short-term stalls such as 15 minute or 5 minute.
            If you wish to park here, you must adhere to these time limits).
        </li>
        <li>You can park without payment at any standard parking space marked for 30 minutes or longer if you have a state-issued Wheelchair User Disabled Person Parking Permit.</li>
        <li>You may also park at any of the 30 new parking spaces reserved for people with state-issued Wheelchair User permits. Most of these spaces will have right-side loading.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>I have a Disabled Person Parking Placard</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you wish to park at a two hour metered space, you must pay for two hours of meter time and then you may park an additional hour for no extra charge. (3- hours total)</li>
        <li>
            On blocks with meters that allow three hours or more of parking, you would pay for the amount of parking you need within the designated time frame. (Refer to the chart below for examples.)<br><br>

        <li>If you are unable to operate the meters or wish to park for longer than three hours or the posted time limit, the City is offering a<strong> scratch-off card</strong> as an alternative payment option. With a scratch-off card, you choose and pay for the time you need from these choices: one, two, three, four or six hours or all day.  You then choose the day and time that you are parking and display the card on your dashboard. For more information on this option, please contact <a href="mailto:parking@portlandoregon.gov">parking@portlandoregon.gov</a> or <a href="tel:503-823-2777">503-823-2777</a>.</li>
        <li>You may also park at any of the 50 new parking spaces the City is establishing and reserving for people with Disabled Person Parking Placards. Meter rates apply.</li>
        <li>
            If you have an ADA placard from another state that does not offer a Wheelchair User Parking Placard and you are a Wheelchair User,
            you may qualify for an "Out of State Wheelchair Parking Permit".
            This permit allows the use to park with the same privileges as an Oregon Wheelchair Placard holder.
            Use the link <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/685319">here</a> to apply.

        <li>You may be eligible for a permit that allows you to park on the street. This permit is specifically for employment access for people who cannot reasonably use public transportation, are not provided parking by their employer, and for whom existing parking garages do not meet their needs. Employees are asked to provide proof of employment along with your application (for example, a pay stub or letter from the employer verifying employment).</li>
        <li>Permit prices vary depending on district. <a title="Portland, Oregon disabled parking pricing map by district" target="_blank" href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/index.cfm?a=489814">View maps of those districts here. </a></li>
