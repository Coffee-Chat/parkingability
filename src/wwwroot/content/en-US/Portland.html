							<h3 class="content-center"><strong style="font-size: 1.1em;">**NEW - Wounded Warrior Placards**</strong></h3>
<p>Starting Jan. 1, 2019, Oregon veterans who qualify for a disabled parking permit and have a service-connected disability that is VA-rated at 50 percent or greater may apply for the new Oregon Wounded Warrior parking placard from the Oregon Department of Transportation’s Driver and Motor Vehicles division (DMV).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within Portland, these placards will be enforced the same as Wheelchair User Disability Placards. Wounded Warrior and Wheelchair Placards holders are exempt from paying at the meter, and may extend the posted time limit for all stalls that are at least 30 minutes (this excludes short-term stalls such as 15 minute or 5 minute. If you wish to park here, you must adhere to these time limits).</p>
<p>For more information on the Wounded Warrior placards please visit the <a title="DMV Wounded Warrior Information" href="https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=3046">DMV site here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="content-center"><strong style="font-size: 1.1em;">Improving Access for All</strong></h3>
<p>The City of Portland strives to balance the needs of our diverse community by preserving accessible parking for persons with disabilities and creating better opportunities for short-term parking in the metered areas of Portland. To increase the accessibility of short-term parking, the City adopted new policies for people using state-issued Disabled Person Parking Placards. The program extends parking meter times for&nbsp;people holding Disabled Parking Placards and adds reserved parking spaces for people holding these placards, including some specifically for wheelchair placard holders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Transportation Bureau assessed the effectiveness of the program in October, 2014 and found that it is working to <a href="/transportation/article/507991">improve availability of parking for all.</a> The bureau will continue to monitor the program and make adjustments as needed. <br><br><strong>How it works<br><br></strong>Current guidelines apply to both types of DMV Disabled Parking Placards: &nbsp;Disabled Person Parking Placards and Wheelchair User Placards. Wheelchair User&nbsp;Placards can be distinguished from Disabled Person Parking Placards by the large white “W” in the upper right-hand corner by the wheelchair insignia, the words “Wheelchair User” towards the bottom, and the light blue color of the placard. Here are examples, for reference:</p>
<p><img src="/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=491735" alt="permit examples" width="645" height="394"></p>
<p>If you are traveling from out of state and your state offers a general disabled parking placard, follow the same parking regulations as people with Oregon disabled placards. If your state offers a wheelchair placard, follow the same parking regulations as people with Oregon Wheelchair User placards.</p>

<li>If you are&nbsp;unable to operate the meters or wish to park for longer than three hours or the posted time limit, the City is offering a<strong> scratch-off card</strong> as an alternative payment option. &nbsp;With a scratch-off card, you choose and pay for the time you need from these choices: &nbsp;one, two, three, four or six hours or all day. &nbsp;You then choose the day and time that you are parking and&nbsp;display the card on your dashboard. For more information on this option, please refer to category 5 below or&nbsp;contact parking@portlandoregon.gov or 503-823-2777.</li>
<li>You may also park at any of the&nbsp;50 new parking spaces the City is establishing and reserving&nbsp;for people with Disabled Person Parking Placards. Meter rates apply.</li>
<li>If you have an ADA placard from another state that does not offer a Wheelchair User Parking Placard and you are a Wheelchair User, you may qualify for an "Out of State Wheelchair Parking Permit". This permit allows the use to park with the same privileges as an Oregon Wheelchair Placard holder. <a title="Out of State Wheelchair User Parking Permit Application" href="/transportation/article/685319">Use this link to apply for an&nbsp;Out of State Wheelchair Parking Permit</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Applications for <a href="/transportation/article/489448">employee permits&nbsp;are available here</a>.</li>
<li>You may be&nbsp;eligible for a permit that allows you to park on the street.&nbsp;This permit is specifically for employment access for people who cannot reasonably use public transportation, are not provided parking by their employer, and for whom existing parking garages do not meet their needs. Employees are asked to provide proof of employment along with&nbsp;your application (for example, a pay stub or letter from the employer verifying employment).</li>

<p><strong><a name="number5"></a>5) I would like another way of paying other than walking to and from the meter.</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parking Kitty App is a new smartphone app that can be used to pay for parking from wherever you need. It's as simple as park, pay, and be on your way. For more information on the Parking Kitty App, <a title="Parking Kitty App" href="https://www.parkingkitty.com/">please click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to operate the meters, use the Parking Kitty app, or wish an alternative to paying at the meter, the City is offering <strong>scratch-off cards</strong>. With a scratch-off card, you choose and pay for the time you need and simply display your scratch-off card on the dashboard.&nbsp; There is no need to walk to and from the meter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How it works: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>a) Tell us which district you wish to park in: &nbsp;Downtown, Northwest, Central Eastside or Lloyd District since each district has different pricing.</p>
<p>b) Choose a scratch off card that meets your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>For short stays,&nbsp; purchase a “3 hour limit” card and you can park for up to 3 hours at any 1 hour, 90 minute, 2 hour or 3 hour meter. For longer stays, purchase a scratch off permit marked for either 4 hours, 6 hours or all-day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/transportation/article/496293">You can view an example of the scratch-off card and fill out the application here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each card can be used only once but you can purchase several at a time and use them as you need them.</p>
<p>c) When you’re ready to use a card, scratch off the correct date and beginning time of use and display it on your dashboard.</p>

<p><a name="number6"></a>&nbsp;<strong>6) Disability parking spaces in non-metered, residential areas</strong></p>
<p>A property owner may request a disability parking space be placed along their fronting property when:</p>
<ol>
<li>Property is located outside of a metered or permitted zone <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>Property is zoned residential <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>There is no off-street parking <span style="font-size: 1.1em;">(off-street parking space definition: </span><span style="font-size: 1.1em;">An off-street parking space included parking lots, parking structures, garages, carports, driveways without carports or garages or any other legal parking space on private property) <strong>and</strong></span></li>
<li>There are no more than 2 disability spaces already on the block face or 500 feet of lineal curb feet from the requestor address <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>The property requesting accommodation is not on an unimproved roadway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The city will contact all property owners adjacent to disability parking spaces by mail every 2 years to determine whether the space is still in use.</p>
<p>Written request must be submitted from property owner and include a copy of a state issued disability placard for someone who lives in the home. Disability parking spaces on public right of way do not meet the ADA standards of private property. Placement of a disability parking space must be adjacent to property of requestor and will be dependent on street furnishing. (Trees, fire hydrants, plantings, etc.) The City will not install a disability parking space in front of a different property than requestors. Disability parking spaces are installed in the public right of way as an accommodation to the requestor and do not reserve the space for any one individual. Any vehicle displaying a valid state issued disability placard may park in the space without time limit. Contact information for field representative in your area <a title="PBOT Parking Technician List" href="/transportation/article/169597">can be found here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
