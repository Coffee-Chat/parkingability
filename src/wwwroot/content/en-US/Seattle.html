<h3>Does my out of state/country disabled parking placard or license plate work for parking in Seattle?</h3>
<p>Valid disabled permits, used by their registered owner, that are issued by other states or countries are treated the same as Washington-issued placards. Any temporary placards, or similar, would be issued by your state or country per local guidelines.</p>
<h3>How can I use my parking permit in Seattle?</h3>
<p>Under Washington state law, the City of Seattle allows on-street parking in general parking spaces at no cost to holders of valid disabled parking permits. Parking may be time-limited for permit holders for no less than 4 hours if clearly signed. Without the 4-hour limit for disabled permit holders, vehicles may park longer than any other posted time limits. Any vehicle parked in Seattle longer than 72 hours may be considered abandoned and subject to citation and towing. In addition, parking restrictions for utility or other roadway work may be posted with as little as 24 hours' notice. <br><br>A disabled permit does not allow the permit owner to use Commercial Vehicle Load Zones, spaces reserved for certain users (including carpool users), or parking in No Parking areas. It also does not allow for parking in load zones longer than posted limits.</p>
<p>Free parking is generally not provided in off-street or privately-owned and managed parking areas, but this is up to the parking lot owner.</p>
